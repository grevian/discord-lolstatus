Thank you for your interest in contributing!

You are welcome to fork and hack away, but if you are thinking of merging your
changes at some point, the following guidelines will make everybody's lives much
easier:

  1. Always start by creating an issue describing what you would like to
     contribute. For bugs, describe how to reproduce the bug. For enhancements,
     describe what you are trying to accomplish, and give a brief roadmap for
     your implementation.

  2. Follow Go style conventions. Sometimes, it makes sense to deviate; when
     deviating, try to follow well-known Go package conventions. For example, for
     "nested struct" names, follow generated protobuf code naming conventions.

  3. Add hermetic tests whenever easy to do so. For new features, you must add
     an end-to-end example in the examples/ folder that illustrates how to use your
     feature.

You will be required to digitally sign a CLA as part of your first pull request.
